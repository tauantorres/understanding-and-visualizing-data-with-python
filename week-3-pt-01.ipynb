    "Subject: Pizza Study Design Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing to provide a detailed proposal for conducting a study that will help our small pizza company, [Small Pizza Company Name], create a compelling marketing advertisement comparing our offerings to our main competitor, [Competitor's Name]. The primary focus of this study will be to highlight one or two of our company's strengths and present credible data to support our claims effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:**\n",
    "To ensure the study is insightful and relevant to our target audience, I propose the following research question: \"How does [Small Pizza Company Name] compare to [Competitor's Name] in terms of customer satisfaction regarding the amount of toppings on our pizzas?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables to Be Measured:**\n",
    "1. **Customer Satisfaction:** We will measure customer satisfaction using a Likert scale, where 1 indicates \"Very Dissatisfied,\" and 5 indicates \"Very Satisfied.\" After each pizza purchase, customers will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the amount of toppings on a scale of 1 to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Amount of Toppings:** We will create a checklist for each pizza order, recording the specific toppings included on each pizza to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection:**\n",
    "To collect the necessary data, we will implement the following steps:\n",
    "1. At the point of sale, our staff will distribute customer satisfaction surveys to patrons along with their orders. These surveys will include questions related to topping satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Our order preparation team will meticulously record the toppings included on each pizza order and cross-reference them with the customer surveys to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Summarization:**\n",
    "To present the data effectively in our marketing advertisement, we will utilize the following graphical and numerical summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bar Charts:** We will create bar charts to visualize the average customer satisfaction scores for both [Small Pizza Company Name] and [Competitor's Name]. This will provide a clear visual comparison of the two companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pie Charts:** We will also create pie charts to illustrate the distribution of customer satisfaction scores. This will help highlight the percentage of highly satisfied customers for each company.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mean and Standard Deviation:** We will calculate and report the mean and standard deviation of the customer satisfaction scores for both companies. This will provide a concise numerical summary of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this study design, we can collect and summarize data that will allow us to confidently claim superiority in the amount of toppings and customer satisfaction over our competitor. These findings will serve as the foundation for our marketing campaign, emphasizing our strengths and attracting more customers to [Small Pizza Company Name].\n",
    "\n",
    "I am confident that this study will provide valuable insights and support our marketing efforts effectively. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss this proposal further.\n",
